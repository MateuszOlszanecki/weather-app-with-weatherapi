# Weather App

## Description

This is a weather management application built with Angular and styled using Tailwind CSS. It allows users to manage a list of cities and view the weather forecast for each of them. Users can add new cities, remove existing ones, and toggle between dark and light modes. The app provides clear feedback for loading states and error handling.

The application is built with **responsive design**, ensuring that it looks and works well on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

## Features

- **Error Handling**: If weather data cannot be fetched, an error message is shown.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator appears while weather data is being fetched.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark and light modes. The setting is saved in the browserâ€™s local storage for persistence.
